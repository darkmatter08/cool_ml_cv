# Some cool ML and CV algorithms

I started out doing some exercises from [UCF CAP5415 2014](http://crcv.ucf.edu/courses/CAP5415/Fall2014/index.php), but ended up implementing a few cool ML and CV algorithms. 

Stuff here: 
- SVM from scratch (modulo the optimization)
- Applications of PCA/SVD
- Naive Bayes from scratch for MNIST
- HOG Features from scratch
- (WIP) Decision Trees on titanic dataset.

Todo:
- More trees
- Boosting/Adaboost
- Some kind of bayesian learning algorithm. Maybe a Gaussian Process? Perhaps start with an E-M clustering algo.

Enjoy!
