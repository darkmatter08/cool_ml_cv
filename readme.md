# Some cool ML and CV algorithms

I started out doing some exercises from [UCF CAP5415 2014](http://crcv.ucf.edu/courses/CAP5415/Fall2014/index.php), but ended up implementing a few cool ML and CV algorithms. 

Stuff here: 
- SVM from scratch (modulo the optimization)
- Applications of PCA/SVD
- Naive Bayes from scratch for MNIST
- HOG Features from scratch
- KNN on a synethtic dataset and the Iris dataset
- K-means on the Iris dataset
- Decision Trees on the Titanic dataset.

TODO:
- Tree pruning on the Titanic dataset.
- More trees - random forests, bagging (bootstrap aggregation), boosting
- Boosting/Adaboost/XGBoost
- Some kind of bayesian learning algorithm. Maybe a Gaussian Process? Perhaps start with an E-M clustering algo.

A useful resource is Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL). I found Chapter 8 on Tree based methods especially useful.

Enjoy!
